<p>
  A really good web development framework anticipates your needs. jQuery does
  more—it practically reads your mind. Developers fall in love with this
  JavaScript library the moment they see 20 lines of code reduced to three.
  jQuery is concise and readable. Its unique "chaining" model lets you perform
  multiple operations on a page element in succession. And with version 1.4, there's
  even more to love about jQuery, including new effects and events, usability
  improvements, and more testing options.

  jQuery in Action, Second Edition is a fast-paced introduction and guide.
  Building on the bestselling first edition, it adds new examples, more labs,
  and deeper explanations of important features. You’ll learn how to traverse
  HTML documents, handle events, perform animations, and add Ajax to your web pages.
  The book's unique "lab pages" anchor the explanation of each new concept in a
  practical example. You'll learn how jQuery interacts with other tools and
  frameworks and how to build jQuery plugins. This book requires a modest
  knowledge of JavaScript and Ajax.
